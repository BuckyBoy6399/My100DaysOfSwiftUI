## Day 7 - HackingWithSwift - 100DaysOfSwiftUI Challenge

> Energy and persistence conquer all things - Benjamin Franklin

### Closures - Part II

Today I learnt about:

- Using closures as parameters when they accept parameters
- Using closures as parameters when they return values
- Shorthand parameter names (ie: ```$0``` and ```$1```)
- Closures with multihand parameters
- Returning closures from functions
- Capturing values from closures

The summary of the entire day was:

- You can assign closures to variables, then call them later on.
- Closures can accept parameters and return values, like regular functions.
- You can pass closures into functions as parameters, and those closures can have parameters of their own and a return value.
- If the last parameter to your function is a closure, you can use trailing closure syntax.
- Swift automatically provides shorthand parameter names like ```$0``` and ```$1```, but not everyone uses them.
- If you use external values inside your closures, they will be captured so the closure can refer to them later.

**That's All for the Day 7 of 100DaysOfSwiftUI!**
