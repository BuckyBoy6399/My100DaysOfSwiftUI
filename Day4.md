## Day 4 - HackingWithSwift - 100DaysOfSwiftUI Challenge

### Loops

Today I learnt about:

- For loops
- While loops
- Repeat loops
- Exiting loops (ie: ```break```)
- Exiting multiple loops 
- Skipping items (ie: ```continue```)
- Infinite loops

The summary of the entire day was:

- Loops let us repeat code until a condition is false.
- The most common loop is ```for```, which assigns each item inside the loop to a temporary constant.
- If you don’t need the temporary constant that ```for loops give you, use an underscore instead so Swift can skip that work.
- There are ```while``` loops, which you provide with an explicit condition to check.
- Although they are similar to ```while``` loops, ```repeat``` loops always run the body of their loop at least once.
- You can exit a single loop using ```break```, but if you have nested loops you need to use ```break``` followed by whatever label you placed before your outer loop.
- You can skip items in a loop using ```continue```.
- Infinite loops don’t end until you ask them to, and are made using ```while true```. Make sure you have a condition somewhere to end your infinite loops!

**That's all for the Day 4 of 100DaysOfSwiftUI!**
