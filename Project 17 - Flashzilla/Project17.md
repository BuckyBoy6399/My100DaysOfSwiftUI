## Project 17 - Flashzilla - 100DaysOfSwiftUI Challenge

### Project 17 - Flashzilla - Day 86 of 100DaysOfSwiftUI

> When it's feeling really good, sometimes people even say it feels natural, or magical - Chan Karunamuni on gestures

Today I learnt about:

- Introduction and Project Setup
- Using various gestures in SwiftUI (TapGesture, LongPressGesture, MagnificationGesture, RotationGesture and DragGesture)
- Working UINotificationFeedbackGenerator and CoreHaptics
- Disabling UserInteractivity using `allowsHitTesting()` and `contentShape()`

### Project 17 - Flashzilla - Day 87 of 100DaysOfSwiftUI

> Code is like humor. When you have to explain it, it’s bad - Cory House

Today I learnt about:

- Triggering events repeatedly using a Timer publisher
- Notifying with the help of Notification Center when app moves foreground and background, user has taken screenshot etc
- Supporting specific accessbility needs with SwiftUI (Reduce Motion, Reduce Transparency, Differentiate with Color)

> We’re going to use the best pointing device in the world. We’re going to use a pointing device that we’re all born with – born with ten of them. We’re going to use our fingers. We’re going to touch this with our fingers. And we have invented a new technology called multi-touch, which is phenomenal – it works like magic - Steve Jobs during the launch of iPhone

Today I learned about:

- Creating a CardView
- Creating a CardView stack
- Creating a DragGesture for the CardView and moving it with the help of `offset()`

### Project 17 - Flashzilla - Day 89 of 100DaysOfSwiftUI

> Accessibility allows us to tap into everyone’s potential - Debra Ruh

Today I learned about:

- Coloring the CardView while swiping left and right offsets with Accessbility (Differentiate Color)
- Counting down with Timer and puasing the timer while app is background
- Disabling Card Interactivity using `allowsHitTesting()` once time is over and reset the stack again

### Project 17 - Flashzilla - Day 90 of 100DaysOfSwiftUI

> if debugging is the process of removing bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in - Edsger Dijkstra

Today I learned about:

- Making haptic feedback on swiping right or wrong card using `UINotificationFeedbackGenerator()`
- Fixing bugs and enhancing VoiceOver support
- Adding and Deleting Cards, `StackNavigationViewStyle()`

### Project 17 - Flashzilla - Day 91 of 100DaysOfSwiftUI

> Things do not happen – things are made to happen - John F Kennedy

Today I completed the Challenges:

- Adding custom haptics when the cards are over
- Created a Settings Views
- Fixed the Card moving offset during the release

Project 17 - Summary:

In this project I learned about:

- UINotificationFeedbackGenerator
- Drag Gesture, Magnification and Rotation Gesture
- CoreHaptics
