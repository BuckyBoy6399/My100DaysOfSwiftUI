## Day 3 - HackingWithSwift - 100DaysOfSwiftUI Challenge

### Operators and Conditions

Today I learnt about:

- Arithmetic operators
- Operators overrloading
- Compound assignment operators
- Comparison operators
- Conditions
- Combining conditions (AND &&, OR ||)
- The ternary operator
- Switch statements
- Range operators

The summary of the entire day was:

- Swift has operators for doing arithmetic and for comparison; they mostly work like you already know.
- There are compound variants of arithmetic operators that modify their variables in place: ```+=```, ```-=```, and so on.
- You can use ```if```, ```else```, and ```else if``` to run code based on the result of a condition.
- Swift has a ternary operator that combines a check with true and false code blocks. Although you might see it in other code, I wouldn’t recommend using it yourself.
- If you have multiple conditions using the same value, it’s often clearer to use ```switch``` instead.
- You can make ranges using ```..<``` and ```...``` depending on whether the last number should be excluded or included.

**That's All for the Day 3 of 100DaysOfSwiftUI!**
