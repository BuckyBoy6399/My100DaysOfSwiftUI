## Day 15 - HackingWithSwift - 100DaysOfSwiftUI Challenge

> Reading code is like reading all things written: You have to scribble, make a mess, remind yourself that the work comes to you through trial and error and revision. - Ellen Ullman

### Consolidation One - Swift Review - Day Three

Today I revised on:

- Properties
- Access controls
- Static methods and properties
- Polymorphisms and typecasting
- Closures 

**That's All for the Day 15 of 100DaysOfSwiftUI!**
