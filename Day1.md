## Day 1 - HackingWithSwift - 100DaysOfSwiftUI Challenge

> The secret of getting ahead is getting started. - Mark Twain

### First Steps in Swift

Today I learnt about:
- Variables
- Strings and Integers
- Multi-line Strings
- Doubles and Booleans
- Type Annotations

The Summary of the entire day was:

- You make variables using ```var``` and constants using ```let```. Itâ€™s preferable to use constants as often as possible.
- Strings start and end with double quotes, but if you want them to run across multiple lines you should use three sets of double quotes.
- Integers hold whole numbers, doubles hold fractional numbers, and booleans hold true or false.
- String interpolation allows you to create strings from other variables and constants, placing their values inside your string.
- Swift uses type inference to assign each variable or constant a type, but you can provide explicit types if you want.

**That's All for the Day 1 of 100DaysOfSwiftUI!**
