## Project 8 - HackingWithSwift - 100DaysOfSwiftUI Challenge

**Project 8 - Day One - Day 39 of 100DaysOfSwiftUI**

> Science is about what is; engineering is about what can be. - Neil Armstrong

Today I learnt about (GeometryReader, NavigationLink, ScrollView, Decoding JSON):

- Setting up the project in Xcode
- Fitting images using GeometryReader
- Learning about ScrollViews
- Pushing views using Navigation Links
- Decoding JSON (Hierarchical Data) using Codable Protocol

**Project 8 - Day Two - Day 40 of 100DaysOfSwiftUI**

> Before software can be reusable it first has to be usable - Ralph Johnson 

Today I learnt about (Codable, Generics, Nested Structures):

- Loading specific kind(type) of data using Codable
- Using Swift Generics to load any kind(type) of Data
- Formatting the MissionViews using DateDecodingStrategy

**Project 8 - Day Three - Day 41 of 100DaysOfSwiftUI**

>  I suppose the quality in an astronaut more powerful than any other is curiosity – they have to get to some place nobody’s ever been. - John Glenn

Today I learn about (layoutPriority(), PlainButtonStyle, Merging Codable Structs)

- Showing Mission Details using GeometryReader
- Merging Codable Structs using first(where: )
- Fixing UI using PlainButtonStyle and layoutPriority()

**Project 8 - Day Four - Day 42 of 100DaysOfSwiftUI**

> Don't Panic, you can do this - A Quote

Today I completed the challenges:

- Adding the lauch date to the MissionView
- Modifying Astronaut View to show the missions flown by the astronauts
- Adding a toggle button showing names of the Astronauts or picking the Dates
