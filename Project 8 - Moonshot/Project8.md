## Project 8 - Moonshot - 100DaysOfSwiftUI Challenge

### Project 8 - Moonshot - Day 39 of 100DaysOfSwiftUI

> Science is about what is; engineering is about what can be. - Neil Armstrong

Today I learnt about:

- Introduction and Project Setup
- Resizing images to fit the screen using GeometryReader
- How scroll view works with Scrolling Data
- Pushing new views onto the stack using Navigation Link
- Working with hierarchical Codable data 

### Project 8 - Moonshot - Day 40 of 100DaysOfSwiftUI

> Before software can be reusable it first has to be usable - Ralph Johnson

Today I learnt about:

- Loading a specific kind of Codable data 
- Using Generics to load any kind of Codable data
- Creating the MissionView Layout

### Project 8 - Moonshot - Day 41 of 100DaysOfSwiftUI

> I suppose the quality in an astronaut more powerful than any other is curiosity – they have to get to some place nobody’s ever been - John Glenn

Today I learnt about:

- Showing mission details in a ScrollView and displaying the badge using GeometryReader
- Merging data using from `(where:)`
- Fixing problems using `PlainButtonStyle()` and `layoutPriority()`

### Project 8 - Moonshot - Day 42 of 100DaysOfSwiftUI

> Don't Panic!

Today I completed the challenges:

- Adding Mission Launch Date to the Mission View
- Adding missions the astronauts has flown on in the Astroanut View
- Adding a toggle button to show crew name instead of launch date
