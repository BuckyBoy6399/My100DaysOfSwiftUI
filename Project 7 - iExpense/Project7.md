## Project 7 - HackingWithSwift - 100DaysOfSwiftUI Challenge

**Project 7 - Day One - Day 36 of 100DaysOfSwiftUI**

> Nobody should start to undertake a large project. You start with a small trivial project, and you should never expect it to get large. If you do, you'll just overdesign and generally think it is more important than it likely is at that stage. Or worse, you might be scared away by the sheer size of the work you envision. - Linus Torvalds

Today I learnt about(@State, @ObservedObject, @Published, UserDefaults, sheet(), deleteRow()):

- Setting up the project in Xcode
- Why @State only work with structs
- SwiftUI state sharing in classes using ObservableObject Protocol, ObservedObject, Published
- Showing and hiding views using Sheets
- Deleting rows in lists
- Storing data using UserDefaults
- Encoding and Decoding Swift Objects using Codable Protocol

**Project 7 - Day Two - Day 37 of 100DaysOfSwiftUI**

> Perfection is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but rather when there is nothing more to take away. - Antoine de Saint-Exupery

Today I learnt about(@ObservedObject, @Environment, sheet(), onDelete(), UUID(), Identifiable Protocol):

- Creating a List and deleting items
- Working with Identifiable Protocol
- Sharing an Observed Object with another SwiftUI View
- Making permanent changes with UserDefaults
- Polishing the User Interface

**Project 7 - Day Three - Day 38 of 100DaysOfSwiftUI**

> Sometimes you need to press pause to let everything sink in. - Sebastian Vettel

Today I completed the challenges:

- Added the EditButton() on the Navigation Bar

- Adding Alert if the amount entered is not a Number Int and a random string value
