## Project 7 - iExpense - 100DaysOfSwiftUI Challenge

### Project 7 - iExpense - Day 36 of 100DaysOfSwiftUI

> Nobody should start to undertake a large project. You start with a small trivial project, and you should never expect it to get large. If you do, you'll just overdesign and generally think it is more important than it likely is at that stage. Or worse, you might be scared away by the sheer size of the work you envision. - Linus Torvalds

Today I learnt about: 

- Introduction and Project Setup
- Why @State only works with Structs
- Sharing SwiftUI state with @ObservedObject
- Showing and hiding views using Sheet
- Deleting items in a list using onDelete()
- Storing user settings with UserDefaults
- Archiving Swift objects with Codable
