## Project 7 - HackingWithSwift - 100DaysOfSwiftUI Challenge

**Project 7 - Day One - Day 36 of 100DaysOfSwiftUI**

> Nobody should start to undertake a large project. You start with a small trivial project, and you should never expect it to get large. If you do, you'll just overdesign and generally think it is more important than it likely is at that stage. Or worse, you might be scared away by the sheer size of the work you envision. - Linus Torvalds

Today I learnt about(@State, @ObservedObject, @Published, UserDefaults, sheet(), deleteRow()):

- Setting up the project in Xcode
- Why @State only work with structs
- SwiftUI state sharing in classes using ObservableObject Protocol, ObservedObject, Published
- Showing and hiding views using Sheets
- Deleting rows in lists
- Storing data using UserDefaults
- Encoding and Decoding Swift Objects using Codable Protocol
