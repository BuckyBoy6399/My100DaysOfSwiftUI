### Project 11 - Bookworm - Day 53 of 100DaysOfSwiftUI

> Data dominates. If you've chosen the right data structures and organized things well, the algorithms will almost always be self-evident. Data structures, not algorithms, are central to programming (write stupid code that uses smart objects) - Rob Pike

Today I learnt about:

- Introduction and Project Setup
- @Binding property wrapper
- AnySize View 
- Combining CoreData with SwiftUI
