## Day 9 - HackingWithSwift - 100DaysOfSwiftUI Challenge

### Structs - Part II

Today I learnt about:

- Initializers
- Referring to the current instance of a struct
- Lazy properties
- Static properties and methods
- Access Control

The summary of the entire day was:

- You can create your own types using structures, which can have their own properties and methods.
- You can use stored properties or use computed properties to calculate values on the fly.
- If you want to change a property inside a method, you must mark it as ```mutating```.
- Initializers are special methods that create structs. You get a memberwise initializer by default, but if you create your own you must give all properties a value.
- Use the ```self``` constant to refer to the current instance of a struct inside a method.
- The ```lazy``` keyword tells Swift to create properties only when they are first used.
- You can share properties and methods across all instances of a struct using the ```static``` keyword.
- Access control lets you restrict what code can use properties and methods.

**That's all for the Day 9 of 100DaysOfSwiftUI!**
