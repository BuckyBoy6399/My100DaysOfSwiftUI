### Closures - Part I

Today I learnt about:

- Creating basic closures
- Accepting parameters in closures
- Returning values for closures
- Closures as parameters
- Trailing closure syntax

The Summary would be covered in the Day 7 of the 100DaysOfSwift.

**That's all for the Day 7 of the HackingWithSwiftUI!**
